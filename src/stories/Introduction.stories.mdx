    Information overload is very much a thing and while we all generally want to make informed decisions, sometimes all the extra info up against the time that you available, is just noise.
  </p>
  <p style={{fontSize: '18px'}}>
    Let's say you are visiting a friend in the city and have an hour to kill but need to eat and being in city you know that you can do way better than the closest McDonals or Dunkin Donuts. A typical search might start like this&hellip;
    <ul>
      <li>Search for restaurants near me.</li>
      <li>Sift thru results and try to decide what you're in the mood for.</li>
      <li>Get bogged down in Yelp reviews cause that's what one does when googling restaurants.</li>
      <li>Try to find out if their coffee beans are Fair Trade.</li>
      <li>Spend a half hour going thru details of the menu and what to eat.</li>
      <li>Possibly obsess over if this fits into a calorie count/diet plan or not.</li>
      <li>Now once you find a place and get your food, now you must hurry thru eating or skip it entirely cause you'll be late for meeting up with your friend.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
    <p style={{fontSize: '18px'}}>This scenario could apply to anything, if you're limited for time and your decision doesn't carry the full weight of who the next President will be or another scenario where copious amounts of research and details matter.</p>
    <p style={{fontSize: '18px'}}>
      The idea of Spots is to search from a list of what's available and choose something that's close or meets a set of distance/time criteria.
      <ul>
        <li>Use your current location (using Exchange Place for demo) and filter based on distance.</li>
        <li>Filter based on what you're looking for, food service, retail, etc...</li>
        <li>Provide directions</li>
        <li>Possible add clues for transit options. (tho not shown in this demo)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p style={{fontSize: '18px'}}>
      We should be able to use a canned list of businesses and pass in the coords to a Google embedded map.
      <ul>
        <li>Get location from HTML5 API</li>
        <li>Get canned location data from locations file/endpoint</li>
        <li>Pass in the info to an iFrame Embed</li>
        <li>Embedded Map API: <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/embedding-map">useDirections</a></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
