    Information overload is very much a thing and while we all generally want to make informed decisions, sometimes all the extra info up against the time that you have available, is just noise.
  </p>
  <p style={{fontSize: '18px'}}>
    Let's say you are visiting a friend in the city and have an hour to kill but need to eat and being in the city you know that you can do way better than the closest McDonalds or Dunkin Donuts. A typical search might start like this&hellip;
    <ul>
      <li>Search for restaurants near me.</li>
      <li>Sift thru results and try to decide what you're in the mood for.</li>
      <li>Get bogged down in Yelp reviews, because that's what one does when googling restaurants.</li>
      <li>Try to find out if their coffee beans are Fair Trade.</li>
      <li>Spend a half hour going thru details of the menu and what to eat.</li>
      <li>Now once you find a place and get your food, now you must hurry thru eating or skip it entirely cause you'll be late for meeting up with your friend.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
    <p style={{fontSize: '18px'}}>This scenario could apply to anything, if you're limited for time and your decision doesn't require copious amounts of research or details.</p>
    <p style={{fontSize: '18px'}}>
      The idea of Spots is to search from a list of what's available and choose something that's close or meets a set of distance/time criteria.
      While the idea is to make a quick decision, the Spots app could also be used for quick planning purposes as you'll see.
      <ul>
        <li>Use your current location (using Exchange Place for demo) and filter based on distance.</li>
        <li>Filter based on what you're looking for, food service, retail, etc...</li>
        <li>Provide directions.</li>
        <li>Show transit options.</li>
        <li>Once you find a place and see it in the map view, you can use the website link to view only what's relevant for that one spot instead of many more otherwise.</li>
        <li>Another use case could be the ability to save locations that you choose so you could quickly get directions to/from.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
